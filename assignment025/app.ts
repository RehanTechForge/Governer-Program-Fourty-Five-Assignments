// Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game.Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
// • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green.If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

// • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

// Set the variable alienColor to "green"
let alienColor = "green";

// Check if the alien's color is green
if (alienColor === "green") {
    // If the color is green, print a message
    console.log("The player just earned 5 points");
}
// Set the variable alienColor to "yellow" or "red"
// let alienColor = "yellow"; // or "red"

// Check if the alien's color is green
// if (alienColor === "green") {
// If the color is green, print a message
//     console.log("The player just earned 5 points");
// }
// Since alienColor is not "green", there will be no output
